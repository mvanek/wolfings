    <div>We will not share your Personal Information with third parties with the following exceptions:</div>

    <div>With your permission. We may share Personal Information with parties that you have given us permission to share that Information. For example, some Users may select to make public Personal Information, such as a business address, on the site. Some Users may select to engage with a third party through our site. For example, users may select a Coupon for a service provided by another User through the site. In order to identify the recipient of the coupon, the third party may access some Personal Information of the recipient. In these cases, we will only share Personal Information with parties that you engage directly with to share information with. Furthermore, the Personal Information shared will only be the information necessary to allow for the receiving party to identify you as a customer. Actions such as selecting a coupon grant permission to share relevant Personal Information with the relevant parties.</div>

    <div>Servers. Wolfings uses third party servers to store and process data. The operators of these servers are not granted access to your Personal Information unless otherwise noted.</div>

    <div>Usage Data. We may choose to publish publically or share with third parties, aggregate use data such as total number of coupons selected or total number of site visitors. While this data may be composed of data linked to Personal Information, it will contain no information that would allow for any individual to be identified. That is, it will be stripped of any personally identifiable features.</div>

    <div>Consultation with Third Parties. We may employ third parties to help us execute and improve our services. Those parties will not have any right to use any Personal Information beyond what we deem necessary to achieve these ends.</div>

    <div>Compliance. We may disclose Personal Information when we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is necessary to be in compliance with laws; adhere to or enforce our terms and conditions and/or other agreements; or protect the property, safety or rights of Wolfings employees of Wolfings L.L.C., users of the site, or other relevant parties. </div>
